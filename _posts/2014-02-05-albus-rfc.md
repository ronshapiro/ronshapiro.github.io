[Albus](https://github.com/ronshapiro/albus) is a project I've wanted to start working on for a little while and tonight I finally got around to writing a simple spec for what I believe open-source crash reporting should be. I've pasted the introduction below - would love to get thoughts/comments/suggestions!

# Albus
Albus is an open-source crash reporter and analytics platform designed to give developers complete knowledge of its inner workings and ability to customize it to their needs.

Albus means white [in Latin](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/albus) and expresses the true desire of the library. Crash reporting should never be a black box - developers should be aware of details like what data they are passing over the network, how often they are doing so, how they can delete their data and how they can mixin their own flavor to the crash reporting. Crash reporting shouldn't be a black box, it should be an Albus box.

## Goals
1. Create a simple, lightweight library that requires little out-of-the-box configuration, has a miniscule performance overhead, and provides great data for developers.
2. Allow users to own their end-to-end Albus experience - create custom plugins, deploy their own servers, and analyze their own data
3. Albus should not conflict with other libraries: Crashlytics, Crittercism, New Relic, and more should all work side-by-side with Albus.
