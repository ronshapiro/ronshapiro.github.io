With the recent decisions of grand juries not to indict Darren Wilson in Ferguson and Daniel Pantaleo in New York City (for killing Michael Brown and Eric Garner, respectively), many have been [calling for more accountability](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/120422/bob-mcculloch-abused-grand-jury-process-ferguson) of police offers through measures like body cameras. While I think those would be great, I think they are missing a huge flaw in the justice system.

In other areas of government, checks and balances are used to make sure no one person or body oversteps their bounds. When they do, their decisions are revoked and order is restored. Though slightly less efficient upfront, the redundancy of the many layers of government help ensure that the democratic system of our country is upheld.

In addition to redundancy, auditing is used to ensure proper usage (or lack thereof) of data and other information. When someone knows they will be audited later, it deters them from doing things they know will be uncovered and used against them. Abuse is therefore minimized (though not entirely) by making people think carefully before acting.

These measures are put in place in many industries. In "the cloud" companies replicate data in case a system goes down, and accesses to information is logged and audited. Similar measures exist in Finance, education, advertising, and more. So why aren't the same patterns applied to prosecution.

If there were multiple independent prosecutors and grand juries for a single, high profile case, or if an individual prosecutor was audited after the fact, the mass public disappointment over the lack of indictment (and in the eyes of many, a fair trial) could be avoided. Without these measures, the prosecutor has the ability to guide the case however they please. If there is a decision not to indict, that decision is binding and set in stone; no one can question the potentially questionable tactics employed.

As in every situation, there's a good paradigm to model from the West Wing: when (Democratic) President Bartlet is about to be tried for lying to the public, he declares that the strongest Republican prosecutor available should be the one investigating him. If he does escape the trial, everyone will know that the prosecutor put their best foot forward.
